# LBR
Heavily work-in-progress.

LBR is a [LWT](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt)-inspired project for learning Japanese. It's intended to make it easier to enjoy and learn from Japanese media, such as books or games by extracting words from sentences and turning them into Anki cards.


## Current features
- Assisted sentence parsing into individual words
- Anki deck generation using saved words and sentences


## Planned features
- Freely usable on a website
- Integrated reader
- Integrated flash cards
- Integrated OCR
- Associating sentences with images and audio
- Japanese-to-Japanese support
- Native application for desktop/mobile


## Where to find things to read
[Aozora Bunko](https://www.aozora.gr.jp/) is a great library of public domain Japanese novels.


## Extracting text from games
[Game2Text](https://game2text.com/) can be used to copy text from games such as JRPGs or visual novels as you play.
